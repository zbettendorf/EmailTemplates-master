<p class="p36"><b>Travel Information for Your Trip</b></p>

<p>E-mail confirmations</p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li57"><span class="s4">Order confirmation email: you will receive an order confirmation within 24 hours of your </span>order submission. This confirms that your flight request has been received by Reward Headquarters.</li>
  <li class="li58">E-ticket confirmation: you will receive an e-ticket confirmation within 72 hours of your order submission. This confirms that your flight request has been secured with the airline.</li>
</ol>

<p class="p59">Printed itinerary: Most reservations are handled with e-ticketing processes and therefore you will not receive a paper ticket, except in certain circumstances. If a paper ticket is required, we will contact you via the email address provided on the travel redemption catalog site. Even though ticketing is handled in an electronic fashion, it is recommended you print your confirmation page to take with you on your trip.</p>
<p class="p48">Photo ID: Every ticketed passenger must have a valid government-issued photo ID (such as a driverâ€™s license or passport). Please note that the name on the photo ID must match the passenger name in the reservation.</p>
<p class="p48">International Travel: Every ticketed passenger must have a valid government issued passport to present to the airline representative at the time of check-in and also to pass through any required security checkpoints. Other required documents, such as a visa, for entry and visitation to a country are the sole responsibility of the passenger(s) to obtain prior to travel and be able to present at time of check-in, if<span class="s2"> </span>required.</p>
<p class="p48">Airport Information: It is advisable to check with the airline(s) you are traveling on for any updated terminal and/or gate information on the date of your trip. You can typically access the airline(s) website to verify current and future flight status and information. It is recommended to arrive at the departure airport at least two hours prior to departure to allow for check-in and clearance through security checkpoints.</p>
<p class="p48">Schedule changes: Prior to the departure of your flight, the airline may change your flight itinerary at any time. If we receive notification of an itinerary change(s), we will attempt to send an email to you with the updated schedule and/or notice to contact the airline directly to manage any issues requiring possible flight changes or alternative flights and/or travel times and dates. Check with the airline 24 hours in advance of your travel to confirm your reservation. If you are flying internationally check with the airline 72 hours in advance of your travel to confirm your reservation.</p>
<p class="p60">Airport Check-In Process: Once you check-in with the airline, you will receive your boarding pass. You will then be required to pass through a security checkpoint(s) to gain access to board your airplane. You can also check-in with some airlines online which will allow you to print your boarding pass. Please check with your individual airlines for this availability. Allow a minimum check-in time of 2 hours for domestic flights and 3 hours for international flights.</p>
<p class="p48">Reservation Updates/Maintenance: With most airlines, you can access your reservation online using either a combination of your passenger name, e-ticket number, confirmation number or travel date. You may be able to select/change your current seating assignment and add information for frequent flyer program(s).</p>
<p class="p48">Boarding: Airline flights may be overbooked and there is a chance that a seat assignment will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for a payment of the airlines choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with their particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation.</p>
<p class="p48">Baggage guidelines: Be sure to review your airlines baggage allowance guidelines. Airline rules for checked baggage allowances vary. Many carriers allow passengers two checked bags and one carry-on while some only permit two checked bags. All carry-on baggage will be subject to search. Review the Transportation Security Administrations guidelines for baggage.</p>
<p class="p48">International Travel: U.S. citizens are required to present at flight check-in a valid U.S. passport. Hospital certificates are not acceptable. Children under the age of 18 years old must present a valid U.S. passport or an original county or state-issued birth certificate or a certified copy of<span class="s2"> </span>a county or state-issued birth certificate. Hospital certificates are not acceptable. A notarized letter of permission to carry the child outside U.S. borders is required from any legal parent or guardian not traveling with the child. In cases of divorce, the original custody papers verifying full custody to the traveling parent eliminates the need for a notarized letter. Non-U.S. citizens may require specific documentation related to their citizenship including a valid passport and visas (requirements vary by country). Visas and other special documents are the responsibility of the traveler including all costs involved. We highly recommend all non-U.S. citizens contact the United States State Department directly for documentation requirements required for your country of origin. U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens are responsible for obtaining current information regarding entry requirements and<span class="s2"> </span>security.</p>
